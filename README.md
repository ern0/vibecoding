Prompt engineering is fun.

I use a simple, iterative method:
craft a prompt, evaluate the output,
then refine the prompt until I'm satisfied.
Each new iteration starts from a clean context,
so the result is based on a single prompt.
I often execute the same prompt against different LLMs to choose the best one.

The gallery code,
the base64 converter, and
the images are all AI-generated.
